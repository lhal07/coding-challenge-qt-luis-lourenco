# coding-challenge-qt

## Goal
​
Develop an app that allows an user to see their albums and respective photos.
​
- Allowed languages: C and C++. Also please use Qt for the interface.
- Albums and photos must be fetched from [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)
​

## Evaluation

- App operates as asked
- No crashes or bugs
- SOLID principles
- Code is understandable and maintainable
- Tests are present
​
## General guidelines

- README should have detailed instructions on how to run the application. Feel free to change this README.
- You are being evaluated on Qt experience, so a well structured interface is important
- *The objective is not only solve the presented problem*. We expect you to send us a code that you believe that has quality, executable and upgradeable. Use this problem to show us your day-to-day practices to write a good code.

## Tips

- The next phase will be a pair programming at SumUp, so keep it simple because we will need to download the project and setup the environment
- The following UI is just a guideline, so feel free to change it at will, but we expect a proper User Experience
